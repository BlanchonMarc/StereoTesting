# StereoTesting
Testing Stereo Vision for research


# main.py

Testing phases using opencv to perform stereo.

One part is for disparity computation

Second part is to compute point of interet using sift features then matching. After, We compute Holography.

Commented part is testing phase to do a step by step disparity map computation


# blockmatching.py

Naive handmade block matching algorithm to build disparity map.
